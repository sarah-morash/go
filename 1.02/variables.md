## Declaring a Variable Using var

- Using var is the foundational way to declare a variable. Every other way we'll cover is a variation of this approach, typically by omitting parts of this definition. A full var definition with everything in place looks like this:

### var foo string = "bar"
- The key parts are var, foo, string, and = "bar":

- var is our declaration that we are defining a variable.
- foo is the name of the variable.
- string is the type of the variable.
- = "bar" is its initial value.
