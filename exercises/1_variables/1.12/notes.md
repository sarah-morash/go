### Zero Values

## The zero value of a variable is the empty or default value for that variable's type. Go has a set of rules stating that the zero values are for all the core types. Let's take a look:

bool: false
Numbers: 0
String: ""
pointters, functions, iinterfaces, sslices, channels, maps: nil

- fmt.Printf uses a template language that allows us to transform passed values

%v: any value
%+v: struct fiield names
%#v: go syntax
%T: type
%d: decimal
%s: string

- When using fmt.Printf, you need to add the new line symbol yourself, which you do by adding \n at the end of the string.
