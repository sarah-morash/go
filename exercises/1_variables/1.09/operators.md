# Operators

- While variables hold the data for your application, they become truly useful when you start using them to build the logic of your software. Operators are the tools you use to work with your software's data. With operators, you can compare data to other data. For example, you can check whether a price is too low or too high in a trading application. You can also use operators to manipulate data. For example, you can use operators to add the costs of all the items in a shopping cart to get the total price.

## The following list mentions groups of operators:

### Arithmetic operators

- Used for math-related tasks such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

### Comparison operators

- Used to compare two values; for example, are they are equal, not equal, less than, or greater than each other.

### Logical operators

- Used with Boolean values to see whether they are both true, only one is true, or whether a bool is false.

### Address operators

- We'll cover these in detail soon when we look at pointers. These are used to work with them.

### Receive operators

- Used when working with Go channels, which we'll cover in a later chapter.
